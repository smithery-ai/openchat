    />
  )
}
```

## Props

- `token` (required): Your Smithery API token for authentication
- `namespace` (optional): The namespace to manage connections in. Defaults to the first available namespace

## Features

- Split-pane layout with connections list on the left and details on the right
- Add new connections via the integrated ServerSearch component
- Delete existing connections
- View connection metadata (ID, creation date, URL)
- Browse and execute tools from the selected connection
- Real-time refresh of connection status

## Architecture

The Connections component is built from three modular sub-components that can be used independently:

### ConnectionCard

A reusable card for displaying individual connection details. [See full documentation →](/docs/connection-card)

```tsx
import { ConnectionCard } from "@/components/smithery/connection-card"
```

### ConnectionsList

The connections list panel with search and management features. [See full documentation →](/docs/connections-list)

```tsx
import { ConnectionsList } from "@/components/smithery/connections-list"
```

### ActiveConnection

The active connection viewer with auth flow and tools panel. [See full documentation →](/docs/active-connection)

```tsx
import { ActiveConnection } from "@/components/smithery/active-connection"
```

Each of these components can be installed and used independently, or together via the `smithery-connections` package.
